# CTFTools
A collection of scripts / tools I've made for capture the flag style challenges / playing with security testing stuff



## Tools:

- Crawler.py: A simple web crawler that shows "flag" in the comments, robots file or cookies of a website and checks for the presence of word "flag"

- 2-time-pad.py: A tool I made in a CTF to xor 2 images encrypted with a 1 time pad to get the key


## TODO:

 - encryption stuff
 - forensic thingy?
 - steg?
 - password thingy
 - notes
